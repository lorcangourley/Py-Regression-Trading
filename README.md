# Stock Price Prediction with Market Momentum & Sentiment Indicators

Currently working on this project for a university assignment, where I aim to predict long and short trades using market momentum, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis. The model leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze historical market data along with sentiment data to predict future closing prices.

### Features
- **Market Momentum Indicators**: Various indicators to capture the momentum of the market, such as moving averages more to be added
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporating sentiment data from news articles, social media, and financial reports.
- **Stock Price Prediction**: The model predicts future stock closing prices based on the gathered data.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- TextBlob / VADER (For sentiment analysis)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (For data visualization)

### Best Model
My current best model used stochastic RSI, RSI & Moving Averages as features to predict the stochastic volatility of GOOGL stock prices.
